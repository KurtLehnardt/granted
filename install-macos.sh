# (installs exactly what's pinned in package-lock.json, and never rewrites it),
# and (optionally) installs Ollama for a fully local run. Safe to re-run: skips
# anything already present/done (npm ci does remove and reinstall node_modules
# each time, which is expected).
#
# After this finishes, `cd granted/scaffold` and run `npm run setup` (cloud
# API keys) or `npm run setup:local -- --yes` (fully local via Ollama), then
